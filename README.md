# libstorj.NET
A .Net/C#-wrapper for Storj

This is the very first version - please excuse the missing documentation at this point. Just the short info: this library is based on the java-libstorj-binding and is done via IKVM. It works except the upload and download and there is still debug-code in it. Use at your own risk!
